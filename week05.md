# Learning Activities & Resources
This week we started learning about child themes in Wordpress. I used this time to read up further on themes and how child themes interact with the parent themes. I spent a majority of my time on my test wordpress site familiarising myself further with how Wordpress the Wordpress base themes format and utilise css, html and php. I spent my time getting more familiar with the develop tools inside Google Chrome and translating these changes to my child theme.

# Content Insights
By utilising child themes, you are able to make changes to a template without modifying the base (parent) theme. This is a very powerful tool as you can modify the child theme and changes will not be removed if an update is installed on the parent theme, thus allowing you to take advantage of any new features and security patches made to the parent theme. 

By utilising child-themes, you are also able to easily structure your customisations and code to easily manage and troubleshoot your changes. 


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By utilising child themes, you are able to separate the base template and your customisations. This improves reliablity when updates are applied to the parent theme. Learning to modify and create child-themes is a key concept required to work with CMSs in an enterprise level.
