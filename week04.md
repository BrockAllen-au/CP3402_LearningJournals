# Learning Activities & Resources
Started looking into local development of Wordpress sites using various different tools. Main technologies I investigated was Vagrant, VVV, Local by Flywheel and Amazon Web Hosting (AWS).

# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 10 hours of my time this week on this subject.

# Content Insights
I spent a majority of my time troubleshooting and following Lindsay's guide for deploying a site via Vagrant and AWS. A lot of issues were run into and I was unable to get this working due to dependancy issues and conflicts in the versions of different components of the AWS Vagrant plugin (last updated 2016 and now seems to be unsupported). Various different versions of Vagrant were installed to try and rectify the issue, but I was unable to get this to work. 

I managed to get VVV up and running successfully with Vagrant and can see the benefits and power of this tool. 

I have also installed and played around with Local by Flywheel as another option for local development. I then followed some guides on how to deploy my Wordpress code to github and setup the connection between my test site and my github repository. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By utilising different local development environments, I can understand how the different setups are configured and begin to understand and adapt to differing environments a workplace may have. These tools are powerful, but to then understand how an organisation will then deploy these to different environments is very powerful. Whether this be through github actions, using tools like WordMove to staging environments etc.
