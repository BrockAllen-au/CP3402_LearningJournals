# Learning Activities & Resources
This week we learnt about PHP (previously known as "Personal Home Page" but now known as Hypertext Preprocessor). PHP is a general purpose scripting language primarily used to develop dynamic web pages. This week I 'forked' Lindsay's 'advice shop' website. I used this to test and work with PHP, making multiple changes and implementing new features. 

On top of this website and PHP, I got exposure to setting up and using 'Scotch Box' to create a local pre-configured web development stack.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
PHP is a widely used scripting language and highly regarded in the web development community. The ability to dynamically create web pages allows a developer to change how content is consumed by a web page. Rather than writing updates directly to a web page, a developer can integrate the web page with a database, allowing for new content to be added to the database and displayed on the web page. No web page modifications required. 

Learning further into secure authentication methods and implementing a more secure website would be my next step in learning databases, authentication and web servers. Currently the data I have utilised has been stored in plain text on the database. Hashing passwords, and comparing these hashes, rather than the plain text inputs would be a great learning experience for user authentication.
