# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I re-familiarised myself with html, css and JavaScript. I also explored bootstrap and its many templates and examples. As part of the practical, I also re-familiarised myself with GitHub, SSH Keys and pushing and pulling from a Git repository. I started to explore the many options of web hosting and began to explore containers with docker. I setup a demo WordPress container with docker and became familiar with some of the documentation available with this tool. I also setup my working environments and began to familiarise myself further with Markdown.

# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 12 hours of my time this week on this subject.

# Content Insights
Bootstrap is an extremely versatile framework and has a large user base. This allows for finding support articles and examples on the internet much easier and the documentation is easy to follow. Containerisation allows for developers to share the exact same development environment so all are using the same setup and tools. This allows for quick and consistent setups between the devs and pushing changes to a production environment much faster and reliable. Getting to understand JavaScript and PHP throughout this subject will be a great learning experience as I don't have much experience with these languages, and can see the power they have in web development. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I found myself reading documentation and examples of the things I was trying to do my preferred method of learning. Looking at an example, reading the code/layout and then playing around and implementing what I was referencing helped to re-enforce the learnings and understand how the code was working. Making small changes and seeing how that affected the site is a great visual enforcement of the learning. 

Setting up developer environments and being able to work locally and deploy to the cloud is essential for employability. I created dev environments locally and began researching how these local environments are deployed to production/cloud environments.
