# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I familiarised myself with the WordPress CMS. I explored the differences between Joomla and WordPress and how they operate in very similar ways and with their own nuances. I experienced the bigger community and support for WordPress with the vast amount of different plug ins that were available and were much easier to integrate and understand high quality ones due to the amount of reviews or ratings left for each. I re-familiarised myself with CSS and exploring elements of websites to find the specific classes used within the template to modify these areas with additional css to get the styles the way I wanted them.

# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 6 hours of my time this week on this subject.

# Content Insights
By exploring the differences between Joomla and WordPress, I was able to see how transferable these skills are. Each have their own nuances, however, the ability to create a very similar website that I created in Joomla in WordPress was much faster. This would be due to the fact the content was already there, however, finding similar plugins and modifying the templates felt much more natural and familiar than the first time working with Joomla. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Working with these different CMS's demonstrated the transferability of skills and the speed in which websites can be created. Utilising these systems allow for extremely fast website building and maintainability with their templates and global styles. Make 1 change on the template and it is replicated across all pages utilising this template.
