# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I familiarised myself with docker containers, web hosting services and the Joomla CMS. I spent my time learning Joomla's interface and how the CMS operates with utilising 'articles' for each of the pages and setting up the different menus. Utilising a local docker container(s) is a powerful tool and opportunity, however, I did struggle to replicate my containers to a web hosting service. I tried multiple different methods and web hosting services to get my containers to run, but was unable to do so. I also attempted to pull a default docker image of Joomla to the cloud hosting service, and have been unable to get that working as yet either. In the end, I utilised the one-click builder in Digital Ocean to create the Joomla environment and learnt how to backup my configurations and database using the Akeeba plugin, and restore my site to the online host via SFTP.

# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 15 hours of my time this week on this subject.

# Content Insights
From watching a lot of videos on how containerisation works, I look forward to delving deeper on to these concepts and utilites. The ability to setup the same environment for all developers and push these changes to the web, ensuring it will work, is a powerful and exciting way to develop. Exploring the options within Joomla, I discovered a lot of different plugins available to achieve different layouts, without the need to write my own code to accomplish the same thing. This creates a much more user friendly environment and quicker turn around on web pages. The ability to create a reactive "staff list" by installing a plugin, filling in the details on the plugin page and adding these modules to the required page is a great example. I learnt how to backup a Joomla site and restore from this backup to another hosting service was a good process to go through. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I again found myself working my way through documentations and running through examples to get a better understanding on how the tools work. I ran through multiple examples on the Google Cloud Platform for containerisation and pulling docker images and watching videos on how docker containers work. With some more experience and working with containers, I will get more familiar and confident with these processes. 

Understanding how a CMS is setup and configured is a great experience. Learning how to configure these further and modify/build my own templates would be a great next step.
